                <div class="box_how1">
                <p>
                It’s the perfect, year-round destination for anyone who enjoys walking, nature, and spending time under a thousand-star sky. A trek through the spectacular High Atlas is not just one of the most scenic hikes in the world—it’s also an immersion into the culture of the Berber people, the original inhabitants of Morocco. Few roads penetrate this rugged mountain stronghold, where the agrarian way of life has changed very little in a hundred years. We are locals, we know the locals, and we’ll give you an insider perspective of this unique culture. You’ll experience the Berber hospitality and discover a simpler way of life.

                     <p>Welcome to High Atlas Hiking. We do more than simply guide you through the mountains. We work with you to build your perfect tour, including:</p>
                     <ul>
                     <li>Coordinating your travel dates</li>
                     <li>Making accommodation reservations</li>
                     <li>Building hikes based around your ability level and thirst for adventure</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Hikes can vary in difficulty from relatively flat, short walks to overnight treks.</p>
                     <p>You set your own dates, decide where you want to go, who you want to travel with, and how much or how little walking you want to do. You don’t have to worry about a thing. We make all the arrangements—from booking your hotels to arranging transportation during the trip. Together with your guide, you’ll experience the area as a local.</p>
                     <p>So whether you are looking for an epic trip, a special weekend getaway, or perhaps something you can't yet define, we look forward to hearing from you and working with you.</p>

                <p>While we’re known for organizing great walks off the usual beaten path, we also pride ourselves on our choice of traditional accommodations and the care we take when organizing your itinerary as a whole. We believe that a truly fabulous holiday is more than the sum of its parts. The walks, your guide, your accommodations, where and what you eat (and even the view when you stop for a snack) can all have a major impact on your trip. We do our very best to make each element exceptional.</p>

After not having luck booking such a tour in Marrakesh, we went back to our original idea of booking through High Atlas Hiking and it was definitely the better decision.<br>

                                        Said answered our E-Mails very fast and detailed and created a private tour for us within just a day! Mohammed was a wonderful guide. He was very open about sharing his culture with us as well as being able to spontaneously change the trek for us based on our fitness and environmental factors. Hassan, our cook, was absolutely amazing. We have no idea how he managed to make delicious three course meals on top of a mountain, but we were always very full and the food was fresh.
