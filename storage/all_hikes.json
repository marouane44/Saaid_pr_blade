Your driver will take you to the starting point of your trek at Imlil (1,780m) where you will meet your guide and muleteer (about 1 ½ hour’s drive). Once you have loaded up the mules, you will begin your trek, which starts with a fairly stiff climb out of the Imlil valley, up to the Tizi n Mzik pass (2,489m), which offers dramatic mountain views. From here, the trail descends down into the spectacular Azzadene valley, known locally as the valley of colour. You will pass the summer village of Azib n’Tansoult and the pretty D’Irhouliden waterfalls, which flow year round before continuing to the Lepiney mountain refuge (3,000m) where you will be spending the night</p></div>",
      "<div class=\"col-sm-12\"><h4>DAY 2: <small>Lepiney mountain refuge - Toubkal Refuge</small></h4><p>This morning you will embark on a fairly stiff climb out of the Azzadene Valley, heading towards the Toubkal Refuge where you will be spending the night. On the way you will pass back via the D’Irhoulidene waterfalls before climbing the Aguelzim Mountain pass (3,560m). Lunch will be taken in a spot with panoramic views over the Atlas Mountain Range. After taking in the scenery you’ll begin a descent to the Toubkal Mountain Refuge (Neltner Hut) at 3,200m. The dorms at the refuge tend to be crowded with other trekkers aiming to tackle Toubkal early next morning so in the summer and when the weather allows we typically camp at the Refuge.</p></div>",
      "<div class=\"col-sm-12\"><h4>DAY 3: <small>Toubkal Summit - Imlil - Marrakech</small></h4><p>Today you will be up early for the ascent of Toubkal (4,167m). It’s a challenging trek to the summit, but, weather permitting, you will be rewarded for your efforts with incredible views over the Atlas Range and the Sahara Desert. After the glory of the summit, you will retrace your steps to the Toubkal Mountain Refuge and then follow the well-trodden path back to Imlil, passing the holy Muslim site of Sidi Charmmharouch. Once you arrive in Imlil, you will be transported back to Marrakech, arriving in the early evening.</p></div>"
