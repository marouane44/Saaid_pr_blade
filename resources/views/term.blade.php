                        <p>There can be reasons why someone may have to cancel their tour and therefore cancellations may be
                            made at any time whatsoever. If you or any member of your party wishes to cancel your holiday,
                            you must notify us in writing, in any case the date of cancellation will be at the date on which
                            notice is received at our offices (not the date of your letter or the date you post it). The
                            person who made the booking form must also do the cancellation. As we must impose cancellation
                            charges to cover our estimated costs. The cancellation charges will apply on the following
                            scale:</p>
